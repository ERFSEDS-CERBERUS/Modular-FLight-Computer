# Message Parser

Im not going to lie, this code works, but looks absolutely disgusting. This is one of the main things where If I had more times or a do over would redo.
It can read a series of bytes and produce a coherent response along with appropriate actions. It is flexible, but not intiutive and difficult to debug. The format for the message is on the google drive.
