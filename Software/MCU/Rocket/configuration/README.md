# Configuration

This module is used to store the current flight data. It can also generate a byte array that can be used to store and load from later for example if some chief engineers insisted you turn of the entire flight computer instead of just disabling the pyro channels for "safety" without listening to the electrical engineers telling them this is perfectly safe.
