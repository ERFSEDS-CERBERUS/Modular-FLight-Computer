# State Machine

THis is a highly overbuilt module that does WAAAY more than it needs to mainly because I was having fun(hey gotta enjoy some of this lol) if you are having performance issues and trace it to this module, an easy kill is all the state checking which is entirely uncecessary but was super fun.

Other than that, this module determines what state of the flight we are in and determines this for the brain
